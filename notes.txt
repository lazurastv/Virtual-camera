- make the window resizable, so the view can be of any dimension
- add controls for letters only
- copy from consts instead of taking directly so we can reset it

- perspective is centered at 0,0 but should be centered at 250,250
- i fixed it, but now the objects dont quite spawn where id expect. I could adjust them but it could be evidence of some other error
Notice how the frame is never taking into account its size
- perspective on rotation is focused at center presumably, which results in weird sizing
