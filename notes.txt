- make the window resizable, so the view can be of any dimension
- add controls for letters only
- copy from consts instead of taking directly so we can reset it

- perspective is centered at 0,0 but should be centered at 250,250
- i fixed it, but now the objects dont quite spawn where id expect. I could adjust them but it could be evidence of some other error
Notice how the frame is never taking into account its size
- perspective on rotation is focused at center presumably, which results in weird sizing
- zoom is fancy move forward, not zoom (should scale what we see, not move forward)

To project a point v we do v' = PVMv, where
v - the original point
M - the camera translation matrix, which is a composition of T, R and S (translation, rotation and scaling matrices)
V - the view matrix, can be calculated using the look at method (link: https://www.3dgep.com/understanding-the-view-matrix/)
P - the projection matrix, encodes perspective = {
    I3, 0
    0, 0, 1/D, 0
}
The P matrix might be described here aswell https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/bb153309(v=vs.85)

Change the current system to operate on these matrices rather than applying the operations to points sequentially
